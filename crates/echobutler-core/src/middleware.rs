//! Request/response middleware pipeline for [`EchoButlerClient`](crate::EchoButlerClient).
//!
//! Lets an integrator hook into the request lifecycle without forking the
//! crate: inject headers, refresh auth on a 401 and retry, or emit
//! structured logs/traces tied into their own observability stack.
//!
//! # Ordering: once per HTTP attempt, not once per logical request
//!
//! [`RequestMiddleware::before_request`] and [`RequestMiddleware::after_response`]
//! run around **every** attempt the client makes for a logical request,
//! including retries triggered by the client's own retry/backoff logic. This
//! is a deliberate choice, not an accident of implementation order:
//!
//! - A logging/tracing middleware wants a span per attempt — "attempt 2 of 3,
//!   got a 503" is the useful signal, not just the final outcome.
//! - An auth-refresh middleware needs to see the 401 on the attempt it
//!   actually happened on, refresh, and ask for an immediate retry — it can't
//!   do that if it only runs once per logical request.
//!
//! Multiple middlewares run in the order they were registered via
//! [`EchoButlerConfig::with_middleware`](crate::EchoButlerConfig::with_middleware),
//! for both hooks. `after_response` short-circuits on the first middleware
//! that returns [`MiddlewareDecision::RetryNow`] — later middlewares in the
//! chain do not see that attempt's outcome.
//!
//! # Composing with retry/backoff
//!
//! `RetryNow` triggers an immediate retry (no backoff, and it does not count
//! against `EchoButlerConfig::max_retries`), so it composes independently of
//! the existing exponential-backoff retry loop. A middleware-requested retry
//! is capped at [`MAX_MIDDLEWARE_RETRIES`] per logical request to guarantee
//! termination if a middleware misbehaves (e.g. a refresh callback that
//! always fails to produce a valid token).
