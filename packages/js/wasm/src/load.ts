// Resolves to the correct wasm-bindgen binding based on:
//   1. Whether we are in Node (import condition "node") or browser ("browser").
//   2. Whether the runtime supports WASM SIMD128 (probed once, then cached).
//
// The four build artifacts produced by scripts/build.mjs are:
//   wasm-web/          browser, scalar  (always available — the safe fallback)
//   wasm-node/         Node,    scalar
//   wasm-web-simd/     browser, SIMD128 (loaded only when detectSimd() → true)
//   wasm-node-simd/    Node,    SIMD128
//
// The scalar import is resolved at module evaluation time via the
// "#wasm-binding" entry in package.json#imports (keyed on "node"/"browser").
// The SIMD import cannot go through that same static import map entry because
// we need to choose it at runtime — so it is loaded via a dynamic
// import('#wasm-binding-simd') which package.json maps to the right directory.
//
// Typing note
// ───────────
// Consumer modules (mood.ts, stellar.ts, sync.ts) use `raw.MoodBuffer` and
// `raw.StellarTxBytes` both as *value constructors* (new raw.MoodBuffer()) and
// as *type names* (#inner: raw.MoodBuffer). TypeScript resolves these from the
// static `#wasm-binding` namespace declaration — so `raw` must keep the type
// `typeof scalarRaw` (the namespace). At runtime, all property accesses on
// `raw` are forwarded through a Proxy to the currently-resolved binding
// (scalar or SIMD). The two bindings have identical API surfaces, so this is safe.
