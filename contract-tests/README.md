# Contract-Test Harness

Shared, language-agnostic contract tests for the EchoButler SDK bindings
(Rust, JS, Flutter, Swift). One fixture serves the *same* canned responses to
every binding; each binding runs its own small runner against it and asserts
the same logical values, so a field rename or path change in any language's
binding fails in CI instead of drifting silently.

## The contract spec

`contract-spec.json` declares every operation a binding must satisfy:

- `target`: `api` (EchoButler API, port 18080) or `horizon` (port 18081)
- `method` + `path`: the **exact** request line the fixture matches
  (query string is significant)
- `request.body`: optional JSON payload sent on `POST`
- `response.body`: the canned response served
- `assertions`: `{ field, eq, path? }` — dotted `path` navigates into the
  response (e.g. `entries.0.score`); fields are the canonical **snake_case**
  wire keys. Every binding is required to surface these values.
- `binding`: which language implementations the op applies to. Bindings whose
  SDK has no HTTP path for an op (e.g. Swift's FFI-generated mood client) are
  intentionally *not* listed.

## The fixture

`server.py` reads the spec and serves exactly the declared routes. Two roles
(`api`, `horizon`) run as separate processes because bindings talk to both.

Run it:

```bash
# Docker (as in CI)
docker compose -f contract-tests/docker-compose.yml up -d --build

# or plain Python for local iteration
FIXTURE_ROLE=api      python contract-tests/fixture/server.py   # :18080
FIXTURE_ROLE=horizon  python contract-tests/fixture/server.py   # :18081
```

An unknown request returns a 404 *listing the known routes* so a mismatched
path is immediately diagnosable.

## Runners

Each runner reads the shared spec and asserts the typed binding's output against
it. When `ECHOBUTLER_CONTRACT_SPEC` is set (as in CI), a missing spec or
unreachable fixture is a **hard failure** (panic/throw), so CI cannot pass
vacuously by skipping. Without that env var, runners self-skip so local test
runs stay green without the fixture. The contract workflow starts the fixture
first and waits for it.

| Binding | Runner | Exercises |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | `crates/echobutler-core/tests/contract.rs`, `crates/echobutler-stellar/tests/contract.rs` | mood + social + stellar bindings incl. typed deserialization and error mapping |
| JS | `packages/js/core/tests/contract.test.ts` | `EchoButlerClient` transport + spec-compliant mood/stellar wrappers |
| Flutter | `packages/flutter/test/contract_test.dart` | `EchoButler.initialize` + Mood/Social/Stellar clients |
| Swift | `packages/swift/EchoButlerSDK/Tests/EchoButlerSDKTests/ContractTests.swift` | FFI validation/bridging semantics (no HTTP) |
| Python | `contract-tests/runners/python/test_contract.py` | PyO3 async bindings — mood streak/summary/log, social feed/leaderboard, Stellar build-transfer/submit/history/balance |

Environment overrides (all default to the CI values):

- `ECHOBUTLER_CONTRACT_SPEC` — path to `contract-spec.json`
- `ECHOBUTLER_CONTRACT_API_BASE` — default `http://127.0.0.1:18080`
- `ECHOBUTLER_CONTRACT_HORIZON_BASE` — default `http://127.0.0.1:18081`

## Known drift (surfaced by this harness, not yet fixed upstream)

The harness intentionally asserts the **canonical** wire shape. Two JS
higher-level wrappers currently diverge from it and are therefore exercised at
the `EchoButlerClient.request` level instead:

1. `@echobutler/stellar` `getTransactionHistory` sends the query param
   `publicKey` (camelCase); Rust and Flutter both send `public_key`.
2. `@echobutler/social` `LeaderboardClient.fetchLeaderboard` requests
   `?window=weekly` and expects a **bare array**, while the canonical route is
   `?limit=` returning `{ "entries": [...] }`.

Swift's FFI fixtures are also a known divergence: mood/social payloads are
generated inside `echobutler-ffi` rather than fetched over HTTP, and
`echobutler_stellar_get_balance_async` targets the real testnet Horizon because
there is no FFI hook to override the Horizon base URL. That op is documented as
out of scope until an FFI `horizon_url` override exists.

### Python drift (surfaced by #148 — first pass)

Four divergences were found between the Python bindings and the canonical spec.
None break the tests in their current form — each is documented and observable
rather than silently hidden.

**DRIFT-PY-1 · `get_global_feed` query string under observation**

The spec's `get_social_feed` op expects `GET /social/feed?limit=10`. The
Python binding's `SocialClient.get_global_feed(limit=n)` should forward the
limit as a query parameter. The contract test exercises the exact spec path; if
the binding sends a different `limit` value (e.g. the default `?limit=50`) the
fixture will 404 and the test will fail, surfacing the drift automatically.

**DRIFT-PY-2 · `StellarTransaction` field names are renamed from wire format**

The wire format (and all other language bindings) uses `type`, `from`, `to`.
Python renames these because `from` and `type` are reserved keywords:
- wire `type`  → Python `tx_type`
- wire `from`  → Python `from_address`
- wire `to`    → Python `to_address`

This is intentional and correct for Python ergonomics, but means Python
consumers must use the renamed attributes. The contract test asserts Python
attribute names with inline comments marking each renamed field.

**DRIFT-PY-3 · `get_stellar_balance` binding list doesn't include Python**

The spec's `get_stellar_balance` op (Horizon direct) lists `binding: ["rust"]`.
Python's `StellarClient` also calls Horizon directly (same code path as Rust),
but was never added to the binding list. The Python runner tests this op anyway.
Follow-up: update `contract-spec.json` `get_stellar_balance.binding` to
`["rust", "python"]`.

**DRIFT-PY-4 · `submit_payment_transaction` binding list doesn't include Python**

The spec lists `binding: ["rust", "js"]`. Python has `submit_transaction` which
exercises the same endpoint. Same fix: add `"python"` to the binding list.
Follow-up: update `contract-spec.json`.
